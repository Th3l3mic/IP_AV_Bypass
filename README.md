# IP_AV_Bypass
=================================
<p>Shellcode to IPv4 </p>
=================================
<p></p>There are two parts in this repository: one is the "encoder," which changes our shellcode into IPv4 addresses, and the second is the "runner," which decodes it and executes it on a victim PC. To successfully encode our shellcode, we must disable Defender. :)
</p>
Remember that Defender checks for signatures and also monitors the behavior of applications, so the code will be undetected for only a short period of time. This is for educational purposes only!

A great shout-out to Incodenito for his amazing YouTube channel! It is one of the best free resources for learning malware development.
